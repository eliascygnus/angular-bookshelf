### Gettings started

ðŸš€ Guideline Client:

  1. Clone repository itself via ```git clone [repository link]``` in your preferable terminal or download with **.zip** format
  2. Install dependencies rather with ```yarn``` or ```npm install``` (```npm i```)
  3. From npm scripts run ```yarn start``` or ```npm start``` to serve application
  4. That's all what you need

ðŸš€ Guideline Server:
  1. In cloned repository open root folder, then in terminal run ```cd mockserver```
  2. There is a fake REST API with [json server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) run it with ```json-server db.json --routes routes.json --no-cors``` pipeline
  3. That's all what you need
