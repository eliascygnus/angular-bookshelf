### Gettings started

Guideline

  1. Clone repository itself via ```git clone [repository link]``` in your prefirable terminal or download with **.zip** format
  2. Install dependencies rather with ```yarn``` or ```npm install``` (```npm i```)
  3. From npm scripts run ```yarn start``` or ```npm start``` to serve application
  4. There is a fake REST API serve ((json-server)[https://github.com/typicode/json-server]) it using pipeline ```json-server db.json --routes routes.json --no-cors```
  5. That's all what you need
